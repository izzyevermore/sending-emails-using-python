# Tkinter - Building Email Client
# Create a tkinter application to send emails.
# The application should have 3 entry boxes. One for "To Email", one for the subject
# and another for the actual message. The aaplication needs to have a button to send
# the email address. You can also add a clear button which will clear all the inputs.
